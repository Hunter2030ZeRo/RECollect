# Tested hardware

Do note that RECollect has been developed and tested on my device, which is same as the following:

SAMSUNG Galaxy Book4 Ultra with Intel Core Ultra 9 185H, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Laptop, 64GB LPDDR5X, 2TB SSD

Disclaimer: As mentioned in README, RECollect is a project that has been developed primarily for MY OWN USE- meaning that the project was optimized for myself, and may not support other platforms like MacOS(The support probability for Linux is unsure, but may be added later since I use WSL2 and Hyper-V). If you wish to add support for more platforms, you are free to do so. Also, this project focuses on utilizing integrated NPUs if there is one, so I recommend you using NPU.
